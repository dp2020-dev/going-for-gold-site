        <h3>Advertising</h3>
        <p>
          Going For Gold displays banner advertisements provided by Google AdMob 
          to support free access to the app.
        </p>

        <h4>What Data AdMob Collects</h4>
        <p>AdMob may collect:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Device identifiers (for fraud prevention and basic analytics)</li>
          <li>General location information (country/region level)</li>
          <li>Ad interaction data</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Privacy-First Advertising</h4>
        <p>
          We have configured AdMob to serve <strong>non-personalised ads only</strong>. 
          This means:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ads are not based on your personal interests or behavior</li>
          <li>Your activity is not tracked across other apps or websites</li>
          <li>No advertising profile is built about you</li>
          <li>Ads are shown based only on general context (fitness/health topics) and your region</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Your Health Data & Ads</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Important:</strong> Your HealthKit data (steps, workouts, heart rate) 
          is NEVER shared with AdMob or any advertising network. Ads are completely 
          separate from your health tracking.
        </p>

        <h4>Remove Ads</h4>
        <p>
          You can permanently remove all advertisements with a one-time $2.99/£2.99 in-app 
          purchase. This is optional and all core features remain available with or 
          without ads.
        </p>
